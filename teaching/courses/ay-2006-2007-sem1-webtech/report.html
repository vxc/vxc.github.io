       <h2>Introduction</h2>

         <p>This is a report on how the <a href=
         "http://www.iiitmk.ac.in/%7Ecourses/ay/06/sem1/itm112-webtech/index.html">
         ITM-112 Web Technology</a> course was conducted
         during the semester AY 2006-2007/Sem-1 at
         IIITM-K.</p>

       <h2>How the course was conducted</h2>

         <p>The course had 2 lectures a week and one
         tutorial, with a two hour lab session each week.
         The lab sessions were mostly self-learning in
         nature, and students spent much of their time
         during the lab working on their project.  </p>

         <p> The project formed a large part of the grade
         (60 percent).  Project work started around the end
         of the 5th week of the course.  Each project team
         (consisting of 4 students) had to prepare a project
         proposal, carry out a requirements analysis,
         complete a prototype implementation, and, at the
         end, submit a final report.  Guidelines for how to
         write the project reports and evaluation criteria
         were precisely specified.  These guidelines and the
         list of the projects and their abstracts is
         available <a
         href="http://www.iiitmk.ac.in/%7Ecourses/ay/06/sem1/itm112-webtech/projects/index.html">here</a>.
         Almost all the projects topics were related to
         ongoing projects at the institute.  They included
         projects in Geographical Information Systems (GIS),
         Agriculture, Health, Grid Computing.  There was
         also a live project done for a metal rolling
         company in Rajasthan.
         </p>

         <p>The course also had a theory (written) midterm
         and final exam.  The midterm lab exam was based on
         oral evaluation of their homework assignments.
         There was no final lab exam.  </p>

         <p>The lectures and tutorials were divided about 70
         percent between the principal instructor
         (Venkatesh) and the rest of the instructors
         (primarily David and Praveen, with a few lectures
         from Siv Chand).  </p>

       <h2>Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Overall student performance</h3>

          <h4>Attendance</h4>            

            <p>The distribution of attendance is shown <a
            href="attendance.jpg">here</a>.  More than 90
            percent of the students had high (greater than
            80 percent) attendance.  </p>

          <h4>Performance in exams</h4>

         <p>Student performance in the exams was
         disappointing.  We feel that part of this may be
         attributed to their poor preparation in the
         fundamentals of Java and Object-Oriented
         Programming. Many did not even know how to compile
         a Java program from the command line.  Most had
         difficulty understanding relation between
         Interfaces, Classes and Types in Java.</p>

          <h4>Programming assignments</h4>

         <p>Students engaged in <span class="loud">wholesale
         copying</span> of solutions to 2 out of the 3
         programming assignments.  This made the whole
         exercise of home works almost meaningless.  We
         decided to grade their homeworks based on oral
         examinations.  Most fared poorly.  Many were unable
         to even run the programs they copied.
         </p>

           <h4>Performance in projects</h4> 

         <p>Performance in projects was much better.
         Students were required to submit an initial project
         proposal, a final report, and also employ <span
         class="loud">blogs</span> to report their weekly
         progress.  The quality of some of the reports and
         presentations was very good.  There was, however, a
         uniform lack of understanding of how to prepare and
         cite bibliography of related work.  This was
         despite explicit instructions to students about the
         necessity of bibliographic citations and how to do
         them using LaTeX bibliography files, for example.
         </p>
          

        <h3>Summary of Student Feedback</h3>

         <p><strong>Oral Feedback: </strong>Some oral
         feedback from the students was gathered during the
         <em>Semester in Perspective</em> session held on
         Nov 30th, 2006.  Some students felt that the
         project was the best part of the course, but two
         months was too short a period to complete a web
         technology project.  At least one student felt that
         the during course he suffered from <span
         class="loud">information overload</span>.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Electronic Course Evaluation:</strong>
         From the <a href="course-eval.html">electronic
         course evaluation</a> gathered from the students it
         is clear that most of them felt the course was
         well-organized, valuable and worthy of
         recommendation to other students. </p>

         <p>A significant minority of the students (about 20
         percent) had reservations about the adequacy of
         physical and computing infrastructure for the
         course.
         </p>

        <h3>Discussion of  Student Feedback</h3>

         <p><strong> Time frame of Project: </strong>We
         agree that two months is too short to
         <em>complete</em> a project, but it is about the
         right time frame to start a project or make
         significant additions to an ongoing project.  In
         future, web technology projects should probably
         involve extending, or being part of existing live
         projects at the institute.  It is a good sign to
         see that many of the students are keen on
         continuing their web technology project for their
         internship. </p>

         <p><strong>Information Overload:</strong> We agree
         that this is one of the big challenges of this
         course. By its very nature, this course involves
         learning many different technologies, software
         environments, and methodologies: Java, Tomcat,
         Eclipse, SVN, MySQL/Postgres, XML and Style Sheets,
         not including the new technologies that were
         specific to their projects.  That said, however,
         there is much that can be done to alleviate this
         problem.  A solid understanding of Java is
         necessary for this course. Eclipse could be
         introduced early in the first semester, perhaps
         with their programming course.  Students should be
         required to learn SVN in their first semester, to
         version control their homeworks and programming
         assignments.  Technical writing skills must be
         imparted well before coming into a course such as
         this. </p>


         <p><strong>Physical and computing infrastructure:
         </strong> We agree that availability of computers
         was a bottleneck in this course, specially during
         the beginning.  However, better utilization of
         existing resources and timely acquisition of new
         equipment by the institute should alleviate this
         problem in the future.  </p>


        <h2>New methodologies and technologies developed and
        used in this course</h2>


         <p>The course provided ample opportunity for
         exploring some new pedagogical and technical
         approaches.  </p>

         <h4>Use of Moodle for Course Management</h4>

          <p>The use of moodle was a great success.  Its
          discussion forum feature brought in a new
          dimension of interaction between students and
          instructors.  It was satisfying to see that
          answers to many questions on the forum were
          provided by the students themselves.  It is likely
          that other courses had a similar experience.</p>

         <h4>Instructor Office Hours</h4>

          <p>Each of us had specific hours marked in our
          calendar for face-to-face contact with students at
          our office.  (These are called <em>office
          hours</em> at some universities.) Some students
          made very good use of this facility, although it
          would have been nice if more did. </p>

         <h4>Involvement of institute projects</h4>

            <p>Many of the project topics were research and
            development activities of other faculty and
            intructors, specially in GIS.  This should be
            seen as an excellent example of the kind of
            synergy that can be created between courses.</p>

           <h4>Peer evaluation by students</h4> 

          <p>Students were asked to submit written
          evaluations of their project peers.
          Unfortunately, most of their answers were bland.
          It seemed that they were uncomfortable writing
          about their peers. </p>

           <h4>SVN for collaborative work</h4>

          <p>The five of us worked in close coordination,
          which was possible only because of our heavy
          reliance on SVN, the tool for versioning and
          collaborative development of programs and
          documents.  We strongly recommend that other
          course instructors and staff at the institute
          adopt SVN for their own work.  There is also a
          great opportunity here for streamlining office
          documentation and paper work through its use.  Of
          course, this calls for training, but there are
          enough of us already who could lead that effort at
          the institute. </p>

         <h4>XML technology for multiple choice
         questions</h4>

          <p>Two of us (Praveen and Siv Chand) designed and
          implemented XML schema and style sheets for
          setting and grading multiple choice questions.
          This technology cut down the time it took to grade
          our final exam.  We welcome other instructors to
          use the XML schema designed in this course.</p>

         <h4>Web-based course and instructor evaluation</h4>

          <p>During the last week of the semester, Praveen
          designed and implemented an online course and
          instructor evaluation.  This is an important step
          in the institute's ongoing effort in automating
          its academic and course management.  Much more
          work needs to done, and the engineering of the
          course and faculty evaluation should make up a
          nice semester long project.
          </p>


       <h2>How this course could be made more effective in
       future</h2>


         <h4>Students should come better prepared</h4>
            <p>Students coming into this course must have a
            solid understanding of Java and tools like
            Eclipse and SVN.  We felt that precious time was
            spent during the intial part of this course to
            bring students up to speed on these
            technologies.  </p>

         <h4>Students should come with writing skills</h4>
           <p> Project work formed the majority the grade,
           and projects were mainly evaluated based on
           written reports.  Some students entering this
           course claimed they had never written a technical
           report before.  <span class="loud">We see this as
           a serious gap in our programme.</span> We suggest
           that the institute include a preparatory course
           in technical writing.</p>

         <h4>Webtech and S/W Engg. course should be closely
         coordinated</h4>

           <p>Although both the above courses were offered
           contemporaneously, there was no communication or
           coordination between the two.  Coordination would
           have helped students apply their s/w engineering
           skills immediately to their web technology
           projects.  We feel that an opportunity was lost
           here, regrettably, due to our own lack of
           initiative.  </p>


       <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p>Most students realize that Web Technology is an
        important course for them, specially for a career in
        information technology.  Overall, the level of
        student enthusiasm and involvement was high,
        although there were some serious lapses (homeworks).
        The projects were well appreciated by the
        students. </p>

        <p>The Web Technology course is a heavy course, in
        its level of intensity for the students, ans also in
        the level of preparation and work for the
        instructors.  Most us spent at least 10-15 hours a
        week (and much more towards the end of the course)
        on various things: updating course pages, posting
        assignments, holding office hours, discussing
        projects, and other activities. </p>
 
        <p>Despite the heavy workload of this course, it
        would be fair to say that the students, and the
        instructors enjoyed being involved in this course.
        There were opportunities for all of us to learn new
        technologies (Hibernate, Spring, AspectJ), and build
        applications of our own.  The course has created
        opportunities for interesting R&amp;D projects
        involving other faculty and staff.  </p>
