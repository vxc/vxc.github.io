       <h2>Introduction</h2>

         <p>This is a report on the <a href=
         "http://www.iiitmk.ac.in:8090/wiki/index.php/Principles_of_Programming_-_ITM_121_AY_2006-2007_Sem2">
         ITM-121 Principles of Programming</a> course that
         was conducted during the semester AY
         2006-2007/Sem-1 at IIITM-K.  The goal of this
         report is to describe how the course was conducted
         and its impact on students. The report also
         identifies how the course can be improved upon when
         taught in future. </p>

         <h2>Objectives and Approach</h2>

         <p>Principles of Programming, was being offered to
         the students for the first time in the institute.
         The course set itself a bold agenda: to impart the
         fundamentals of programming and software to
         students, not in isolation, but by applying them to
         the latest web technology frameworks.  This
         applicative approach was the result of Dr. T B
         Dinesh working closely with the Principal Instructor in designing the
         syllabus, and the lab exercises for the course,
         which included designing a web 2.0 spreadsheet
         application.
         </p>

	 <h2>Course Format</h2>

         <p>The course had 2 lectures a week and one
         tutorial, with a two hour lab session each week.
         The lab sessions were mostly self-learning in
         nature, and students spent much of their time
         during the lab working lab assignments.  All the
         classes were taken by the principal
         instructor. </p>

         <h2> Evaluation</h2>

         <p> The final grade was divided between a midterm,
         a final, and quizzes.  Homework assignments were
         assigned but not graded.  
         </p>


       <h2>Analysis</h2>


        <h3>Overall student attendance</h3>

          title="Attendance distribution in Principles of Programming course"
          alt="Attendance distribution in Principles of Programming course"
          class="float-right" />

         <p>The classes (lectures and tutorials and labs)
         were well attended.  More than 80% of the students
         attended 80% of the classes.  </p>

       <h3>Performance in exams</h3>



         <p>Student performance in the midterm exam was
         disappointing.  We feel that part of this was
         because the students did not know "what to expect
         in the exam".  All problems in the exam were "fill
         in the blanks" type, where the students had to
         <em>read</em> program code rather than write.</p>

          alt="Distribution of midterm performance"
          class="float-right" />


         <p>To remedy the situation and to get more
         continuous feedback about student performance, we
         decided to introduce weekly quizzes after the
         midterm.  This turned out to be a good idea, and
         students responded well, with improved
         performance. </p>

          title="distribution of Quiz performance"
          alt="Distribution of quiz performance"
          class="float-right" />


         <p>Students mostly did well on the final exam.  To
         be sure, the exam was easy, but some of the credit
         for the good performance clearly belongs to the
         students. </p>

          title="distribution of Final performance"
          alt="Distribution of final performance"
          class="float-right" />


	 <h3>Programming Lab assignments</h3>

         <p> We decided against grading homework assignments
         because of the difficulty in controlling plagiarism
         and copying.  Instead we based some of the quizzes
         on the lab assignments.
	 </p>

        <h2>Summary of Student Feedback</h2>


         <p>We conducted a survey when the course was about
         three fourths through to obtain feedback and some
         validation about our approach in the course. </p>

         <h3> Students preferred working with multiple
         languages in a course</h3>

         <p>This course employed two languages, Scheme and
         Javascript, for teaching the Principles of
         Programming.  Neither of these languages were
         formally taught.  The idea of using two languages:
         one for the lectures another for the lab was driven
         both by pedagogical and technological
         considerations.  While Scheme seems perfect for
         introducing programming pedagogy, Javascript is
         specially suited for building web applications in
         today's Web 2.0 technological scenario.  Both
         languages are different in syntax but are closer
         semantically.  Hence the choice provided an
         excellent platform to compare computational
         concepts across the two languages.  The students
         seemed to agree with these ideas, almost two to
         one.</p>

	    height="200"
          title="One vs. Two languages"
          alt="Response to whether using two languages in a course was useful"
          class="float-right" />

         <h3> Students wished they had Scheme as
         introductory programming language </h3>

	 <p>Our course used Scheme for the lecture
	 materials.  The students appreciated the economy of
	 expression in Scheme and also its structure which
	 made all computational ideas clear and transparent.
	 They agreed, again 2-to-1, that given a choice,
	 they would have liked to have  their
	 introductory programming course based on Scheme. 
	 </p>

          title="Choice of introductory language"
          alt="Choice of  language in introductory programming course"
          class="float-right" />

           
         <p><strong>Oral Feedback: </strong>This response in
         the survery corroborated oral feedback from the
         students garnered during casual, break room
         conversations several weeks before the survey was
         taken.  Students were greatly appreciative of the
         impact the course was making in their understanding
         of programming in general.  Some wondered why this
         course was not taught in their first semester,
         instead of the Object Oriented Programming in Java
         course.  This opinion is also shared by at least
         two of the associate instructors,Shabeer and
         SivChand.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Electronic Course Evaluation:</strong>
         Student evaluation indicated a moderately high
         level of satisfaction. Answers to all questions
         were rated greater than 4 out of the maximum 5.
         Evaluation of the Principal Instructor rated at
         higher than 4.5 for all the questions.
	 </p>

         <p> The main criticism from the students was that
         Javascript programming was inadequately covered in
         the labs.  According to the students, more time and
         effort should have been spent teaching the basics
         of Javascript and its libraries.
	 </p>

        <h2>Methodologies and technologies used in this
        course</h2>


         <p>This course made use of the latest technologies
         for teaching and sharing content.  The goal, from
         the beginning, was to build the course in a
         completely open manner that made it possible for
         everyone on the internet to share and contribute to
         the course. </p>

         <h3> Wiki based open course</h3>

         <p>The course was hosted not on an moodle site
         internal to IIITM-K, but on an gloabally accessible
         <a
         href="http://www.iiitmk.ac.in:8090/wiki/index.php/Principles_of_Programming_-_ITM_121_AY_2006-2007_Sem2">
         wiki</a>.
         </p>

         <h3> Use of  google newsgroup</h3>
 
         <p> Keeping in view the open nature of the course,
         the default newsgroup of the course was a
         world-accessible google newsgroup <a
         href="http://groups.google.com/group/popjs-2007-iiitmk?lnk=gschg">popjs-2007-iiitmk_AT_googlegroups.com</a>.
	 </p>

         <h3>Moodle</h3>

          <p>Moodle was used by students at IIITM-K for
          specific, local purposes like submitting homework
          assignments. </p>

         <h3>Instructor Office Hours</h3>

          <p>Like last semester, the instructors maintained
          specific weekly hours for face-to-face meetings
          with students in their offices.  Some students
          made very good use of this facility, although it
          would have been better if more did. </p>

        <h3>SVN for collaborative work</h3>

          <p>All students were required to use SVN for doing
         their homeworks.  The students' work was version
          controlled and backed up thanks to the svn server
          and the backup server it was tied to.  </p>

	<p> In addition, all the instructors and
	co-instructors, along with Dr. Dinesh from
	Bangalore, relied heavily on SVN and the Wiki to
	develop code, exams and other instructional
	material.  We strongly recommend that other course
	instructors and staff at the institute adopt SVN for
	their own work.  There is also a great opportunity
	here for streamlining office documentation and paper
	work through its use.  There are already enough of
	us who can teach SVN and its benefits to all at the
	institute, so training in the use of this other
	productivity tools should not be a problem. </p>

       <h3>XML technology for multiple choice
         questions</h3>

        <p>We relied XML Schema and Style Sheet developed
          earlier by Siv Chand to set the quizzes in
          XML. </p>




       <h2>How this course could be made more effective in
       future</h2>


       <h3>Students should participate more</h3>
            <p>Although we emphasized from the beginning the
            participatory nature of this course, students
            were diffident when interacting in the classroom
            or on the news group.  Next semester, I plan to
            increase the weight of class participation
            substantially, and encourage other instructors
            to do the same.
            </p>

            <p>Students were much more articulate in writing
            their opinions in the in-class survey.  The
            instructors were impressed with the insightful
            opinions that some of the students had regarding
            the course.
	    </p>

       <h3>Provide ergonomic furniture that supports use of
       notebook computers in classroom </h3>

        <p>At least one student observed, and we agree, that
        the chairs in the class were designed hold paper
        notebooks but not notebook computers.  This
        prevented students from using their notebook
        computers in class to work alongside the instructor
        on programming material discussed in the class.</p>

        <p>The institute should consider buying furniture
        that allows the ergonimic use of notebook computers
        in classrooms.  This issue should be considered when
        furnishing the new classrooms coming up in Nila in
        the next few months and refurnish the existing
        classrooms in Park Centre.</p>


       <h3>Closer relation with other courses</h3>

       <p>We like to think of this course as laying the
        foundation for software systems and engineering.
        Therefore, this course should be linked closely with
        other courses like data structures, discrete
        mathematics, embedded systems, web technologies and
        databases.
       </p>

       <h2>Conclusions</h2>

       <p>This is the first time the Principles of
       Programming was offered at the institute.  Most
       students realized and appreciated the foundational
       impact of this course.  </p>

        <p>The wiki approach was a definite success, with
        the content being populated by several sources,
        including some students.  </p>
 
        <p>We feel that the Principles course should form
        the nucleus of an integrated Foundations of Software
        Engineering stream offered to post-graduate
        students.  To be truly integrated, the course's
        syllabus and assignments will have to be closely
        linked with those in other foundational courses like
        discrete maths, data structures, and databases.
