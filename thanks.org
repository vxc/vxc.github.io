Thanks to all
who liked the poem,
I'd love to write more.
I hope I can do 'em.

Just a mish and quite a mash.
Bits of Geisel, a pinch of Nash.
No rhyme, and not a reason.
It was only to bring Levity,
to this morbid season.

Thanks, Kamal!
For that sporty duel.
I Promise!  No more of this kitschy stuff!
You've probably already had enough!

But before I sign off
I'm sure you agree.
It isn't the degree,
or a lucrative position.
What our students need is
an aesthetic disposition.

Let them learn that 
whatever they build
is a work of art.
To create beauty, 
they need to put 
not just their mind, 
but also their heart. 


Right now though, while we are missing them,
a strange world, and stranger times, await them,
Fear and doubt threaten to negate them.
But they will come around, succeed, and lead.
They always have, when there is a need.
